# Password-Generator
Creating a website that will generate a password based on criteria the user gives.


## Description
I want to create a UI design that effectively communicates the purpose and function of the website. The user should be able to easily navigate the website and create a new password. The user will then decide what kind of password they create by answering some questions the website will prompt. After the user has finished their input the website will use java script to randomly generate a password.

The user should be able to then copy that password to their local clipboard. Additionally we could store previous passwords, so if anyone hacked them they could easily find all that information.

## Website_Design
The website will be designed in a minimist way, presenting only important information to the user. The website will clearly instruct the user on how to start using the password generator.

Additionally the user will be able to copy to their clipboard the new password after they finish creating one.

## User_Prompts
After the user has stated they would like to make a password, buttons will appear upon the screen and the user will turn on or off the type of characters that they want.

The answer to the questions will determine what kind of password is generated. 

## Password_Generation
After the user has chosen all of their preferences for their password, we will store that information, and then using java script we will formulate a randomly generated password.

This password will display on screen for the user to see.

Additionally the user will have the option to copy the password to their clipboard.

## Credits
As I continue this journey and collaborate with more colleagues, I will add their names and contact info to this list.

For now I would like to think UoR Coding Boot camp instructors, John and Greg, and the TA's. As well as my supportive family.
